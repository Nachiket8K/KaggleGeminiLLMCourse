    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

The world was a symphony of smells - damp leaves, earthworms, and the tantalizing aroma of a nearby bakery. He stalked through the overgrown garden, a furry hunter navigating a jungle of sunflowers and tangled vines. He chased a flitting sparrow, its brown feathers blurring against the blue sky, and surprised a plump squirrel with a sudden leap.\n",

      "His adventure led him to the edge of the park, where the air buzzed with the chatter of children and the playful bark of dogs. Barnaby, the fearless explorer, found himself captivated by a group of squirrels, their bushy tails twitching as they scampered up a towering oak. He climbed, his claws finding purchase in the rough bark, until he reached the top. From his lofty perch, Barnaby surveyed his domain.\n",

      "The world stretched before him - a tapestry of green and gold, punctuated by the glint of the distant river. He watched the children play, their laughter echoing in the crisp air, and the squirrels chase each other among the branches. He was a king, surveying his kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the sun began to dip, casting long shadows across the park. It was time to return home. Barnaby descended the oak, his heart full of the thrill of his adventure. He slipped back through the gap in the fence, a small, triumphant smile on his whiskered face.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mrs. Higgins came home, a small, muddy paw print on her skirt was the only evidence of Barnaby's daring escapade.  But Barnaby, curled up on his favorite cushion, knew he'd carried a piece of the world with him - the smell of damp leaves, the warmth of the sun on his fur, and the thrill of the unknown. And he knew, with absolute certainty, that he would be back for more adventures soon. \n",
