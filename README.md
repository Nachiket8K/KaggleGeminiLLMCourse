# 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course

Welcome to my repository for the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course offered by Kaggle. This course provided a comprehensive introduction to Generative AI, covering foundational concepts and practical applications.

## Course Overview

The course spanned five days, each focusing on a specific aspect of Generative AI:

1. **Day 1: Introduction to Generative AI**
   - Overview of Generative AI and its significance.
   - Exploration of various generative models and their applications.

2. **Day 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - Understanding the architecture and functioning of GANs.
   - Hands-on implementation of a basic GAN model.

3. **Day 3: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
   - Introduction to VAEs and their role in data generation.
   - Building and training a VAE for image generation.

4. **Day 4: Text Generation with Transformers**
   - Utilizing transformer models for natural language processing tasks.
   - Implementing a text generation model using transformers.

5. **Day 5: Advanced Topics and Applications**
   - Exploring advanced generative models and their real-world applications.
   - Discussion on ethical considerations and future directions in Generative AI.
