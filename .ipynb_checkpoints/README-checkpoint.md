# 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course

Welcome to my repository for the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course offered by Kaggle. This course provided a comprehensive introduction to Generative AI, covering foundational concepts and practical applications.

## Course Overview

The course spanned five days, each focusing on a specific aspect of Generative AI:

1. **Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering**
   - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

3. **Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases**
   - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

4. **Day 3: Generative AI Agents**
   - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

5. **Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs**
   - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

6. **Day 5:MLOps for Generative AI**
   - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
